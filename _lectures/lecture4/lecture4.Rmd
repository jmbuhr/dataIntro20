## What is probability?

Say you and your friends are playing Mario Kart
(or a similar racing game),
when one of your friends proudly proclaims:
"I am the best player among us!"
"Proof it!", you reply.
"That's easy", she says: "I won first place

### Binomial Distribution

The Galton Board

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
n_layers <- 15
p <- 0.5
n_paths <- 1000

get_random_path <- function(n_layers, p) {
  s <- sample(c(-0.5, 0.5), n_layers, replace = TRUE, prob = c(p, 1 - p))
  c(0, cumsum(s))
}

galton <- tibble(
  trial = 1:n_paths,
  path = map(trial, ~ get_random_path(n_layers, p))
) %>% 
  unnest_longer(path) %>% 
  group_by(trial) %>% 
  mutate(h = n():1)

board <- tibble(
  h = 1:n_layers,
  trial = 1
) %>% 
  mutate(path = map(h, function(h) {
    x <- (n_layers - h)
    (-x/2):(x/2)
  })) %>% 
  unnest_longer(path) %>% 
  mutate(h = h + 0.4)
```


```{r}
library(gganimate)

galton %>% 
  ggplot(aes(path, h, group = trial)) +
  geom_path(alpha = 0.1, size = 2,  lineend = "round") +
  geom_point(data = board) +
  theme_void() +
  # transition_reveal(along = trial) +
  NULL
```


```{r}
galton %>% 
  filter(h == 1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(path)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = stat(count) / sum(count)), binwidth = 0.5)

## Statistically Significant...

  I don't think it means what you think it means.
