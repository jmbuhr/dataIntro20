## Tidy data

There is one concept which also lends it's name to the tidyverse that I want to talk about. **Tidy Data** is a way of turning your datasets into a uniform shape. This makes it easier to develop and work with tools because we get a consistent interface. Once you know how to turn any dataset into a tidy dataset, you are on home turf and can express your ideas more fluently in code. Getting there can sometimes be tricky, but I will give you the most important tools. Because...

So, how can we recognize tidy data?

(ref:tidy) Figure from <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html> [@wickhamDataScienceImport2017]

```{r tidy-definition, fig.cap="(ref:tidy)", out.extra="class=external", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("img/tidy-data-wickham.png")
```

In tidy data, each variable (feature) forms it's own column. Each observation forms a row. And each cell is a single value (measurement).

The `tidyr` package contained in the tidyverse provides small example datasets to demonstrate what this means in practice. Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund use these in their book as well (<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html>)[@wickhamDataScienceImport2017].

### Making Data Tidy

with the `tidyr` package.

TODO: not mentioned: data that is better in another format, matrices, matrix math, arrays

## Iteration

### Reading in Multiple Files

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

read_csv("data/Africa.csv")

paths <- dir("data", full.names = TRUE)
names(paths) <- basename(paths) %>% str_remove("\\.csv")

my_data <- map(paths, read_csv)

combinded_data <- my_data %>% 
  bind_rows(.id = "continent")
```

```{r}
gapminder <- map_dfr(paths, read_csv, .id = "continent")
```

```{r}
results <- vector("list", length(paths))
for (i in 1:length(paths)) {
  data <- read_csv(paths[i])
  data$continent <- names(paths[1])
  results[[i]] <- data
}

dataset <- bind_rows(results)
dataset
```
